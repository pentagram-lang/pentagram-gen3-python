## About

Tacit is a friendly programming language that uses **ergonomics**, **determinism**, and **efficiency** to help you express your creativity.

- With powerful features like **significant whitespace** and **functional programming**, the Tacit language works together with you and helps you out at every step.

- The Tacit community is here to help too! We know how tough coding can be, and we do our best to make this a safe space where **kindness** and **empathy** are the norm.

### The code here

The code here in this Git repo is a temporary interpreter (in Python), created to help bootstrap a self-recursive Tacit compiler.

## Developing

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Python 3.7.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/) and [Direnv](https://direnv.net/).

### Initial setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tacit-lang/tacit-gen3-python.git
cd tacit-gen3-python
direnv allow
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Commands

- `pytest-watch` to start testing code changes

### Python packages

1. Change installed packages with `pip install` or `pip uninstall`
2. Upgrade and freeze all packages with `./pip_freeze.sh`
